Use protoc version 3.24.x or newer and install the protoc-gen-go plugin for code generation. Generate Go code with protoc --go_out=./pb --go_opt=paths=source_relative shoe.proto. For Confluent Schema Registry compatibility, register the shoe.proto schema before producing messages, and use the confluent-kafka-go/v2/schemaregistry client for serialization and schema management. When updating the schema, only add new fields with new numbers and never reuse or change existing field numbers to maintain compatibility.

Go code was generated using protoc v3.21.12 and protoc-gen-go v1.36.7, resulting in pb/shoe.pb.go with all necessary structures. devcontainer.json now includes automatic protoc installation for future rebuilds. Functionality was verified by instantiating the Shoe struct in test_shoe.go, confirming getter methods and protobuf serialization, and updating go.mod with the google.golang.org/protobuf dependency.

Use the latest supported Kafka version (e.g., `config.Version = sarama.V3_5_0_0`).\n- Use `sarama.NewAsyncProducer` for non-blocking message production. Implement dedicated goroutines to consume both `Successes()` and `Errors()` channels to prevent deadlocks and ensure all outcomes are logged.\n- On startup, validate connection by sending a test message and confirming delivery via the `Successes()` channel.\n- Implement structured logging for all producer events, including topic, partition, offset, and error details.\n- Tune retry settings (`config.Producer.Retry.Max`) for reliability, and consider enabling idempotence (`config.Producer.Idempotent = true`) and compression (`config.Producer.Compression = sarama.CompressionSnappy`) for production scenarios.\n- Prepare for future enhancements such as graceful shutdown and metrics integration for monitoring producer health.\n</info added on 2025-08-18T10:21:55.384Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-18T10:56:27.917Z>\nConfluent Cloud connectivity has been successfully established using SASL_SSL authentication.

The timing configuration is loaded from the `.env` file using `cfg.App.MessageInterval`. Go's `time.NewTicker()` is used for precise, regular intervals, ensuring non-blocking message production. The ticker is properly cleaned up during shutdown to prevent resource leaks, and the timing loop respects context cancellation for graceful termination. This approach allows the production rate to be adjusted without code changes, maintaining high system performance and resource efficiency. Example `.env` configurations include:\n\nMESSAGE_INTERVAL=1s      # 1 message per second (default)\nMESSAGE_INTERVAL=500ms   # 2 messages per second (faster)\nMESSAGE_INTERVAL=5s      # 1 message every 5 seconds (slower)\nMESSAGE_INTERVAL=10ms    # Very high frequency (100 messages/second)\n</info added on 2025-08-18T14:58:07.618Z>",
